# Typing Tool Plan

- There will be a different set of keys alongside the existing one to enable language typing. Like for क्ष -> kSh.
- It will also have a way to type script-specific character which are unique to it.
- In the conversion algorithm there will also be a mode where the conversion will also use the data from the additional set. This can be used to study/analyze the script without losing its details when converting it to "Normal" script.

## Preparations

- Make a test to convert Normal to all other scripts. As in typing the Normal to Other Script transliteration will be used.
