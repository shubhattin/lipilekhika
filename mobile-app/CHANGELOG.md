# Changelog

## Unreleased

- The Compare tab of the typing help shows the other spellings of the compared script under each letter (_Alternates_ toggle), mostly useful for ITRANS: `R^i` for `RRi`, `aa` for `A`, `chh` for `Ch`, `x` for `kSh`, and a few for IAST and Romanized (`r̥` for `ṛ`).

## mobile-app@v0.3.0+11

- **A native app** (Kotlin, Jetpack Compose) replaces the Flutter app. It installs as an update and keeps your scripts, preset and theme.
- New look, the same as the web app: denser layout, smaller corners, the Geist font, and the script fonts built in (they work offline).
- **Select text in any app → "Lipi Lekhika"** converts it in a small sheet: Replace or Copy.
- **Share → Lipi Lekhika** opens the shared text in the app.
- **Quick Settings tile** "Convert clipboard".
- Searchable script picker, with Modern / Latin / Ancient sections and aliases (`hi`, `tam`, `hk`, ...).
- Open and save `.txt` files, Undo / Redo, Clear with "Undo clear", and the text kept between launches (turn off _Remember text_ in the text box's ⋮ menu to not keep it).
- Quick toggles for the inherent vowel (`k → क`) and native numerals (`1 → १`) in the text box, and live examples in the typing options. Both options are now remembered.
- The preset is always visible above the options.
- New _Standard Schemes_ group with IAST, ITRANS, Harvard-Kyoto and SLP1
