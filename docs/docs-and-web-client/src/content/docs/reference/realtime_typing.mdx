Lipi Lekhika also has a mechanism to implement realtime typing. It is based on the core transliteration functionality. On every the algorithm compares with the previus output and returns a diff.
That diff contains the text to add and characters to delete. The API is same in all languages. The only difference is in naming conventions (snake_case or camelCase).
All the packages (JS, Python, Go and Rust) have embedded types and Documentation to provide realtime docs and type support in your editor.
The algorithm automatically manages the input history context internally to optimize the typing latency.

## createTypingContext

```ts
import { createTypingContext } from 'lipilekhika/typing';
const ctx = createTypingContext('Devanagari');
```

Returns a closure which has these these methods:

- `ready` : Awaits once, then use `takeKeyInput` for best typing latency.
- `clearContext` : Cleares all internal states and contexts
- `takeKeyInput` : Accepts character by character input and returns the diff
- `updateUseNativeNumerals` : Updates the use of native numerals in transliteration/typing
- `updateIncludeInherentVowel` : Updates the include inherent vowel in transliteration/typing

### Custom Typing Options

You can also pass custom options. Below are default values usage

```ts
import { createTypingContext } from 'lipilekhika/typing';
const ctx = createTypingContext('Devanagari', {
  autoContextClearTimeMs: 4500,
  useNativeNumerals: true, // use native numerals. Example: 10 -> १०
  includeInherentVowel: false // no inherent vowel by default. Example: k -> क्
});
```

- **`autoContextClearTimeMs`** : The time in milliseconds after which the context will be cleared automatically
- **`useNativeNumerals`** : Use native numerals in typing
- **`includeInherentVowel`** : Include inherent vowel in typing. This is the [schwa deletion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwa_deletion_in_Indo-Aryan_languages) property.
